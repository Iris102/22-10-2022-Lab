            <p>This is Jack. He's an odd little boy that just got an empty box for his birthday. He may look happy, but he's a <i>little</i> disappointed. Now he'll have to put a few things in the box.
            </p>
            <p>Jack would really like...
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Roller blades</li>
                <li>Magic tricks</li>
                <li>Anything Pokemon</li>
                <li>A motorized Lego set</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can get all this (and more) at an online toy store. Two very popular ones are <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/">toysrus.com </a> and <a href="http://www.etoys.com/">eToys</a></p>
